## üïí Dynamic Date Calculation System

### Base Date: July 20, 2025

### Timeline Calculation Functions
```javascript
// Dynamic Timeline Calculator
class TimelineCalculator {
  constructor(baseDate = '2025-07-20') {
    this.baseDate = new Date(baseDate);
  }
  
  // Traditional timeline calculations
  traditionalPhase(phaseNumber, durationWeeks) {
    const startDate = new Date(this.baseDate);
    startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + (phaseNumber - 1) * 7 * durationWeeks);
    
    const endDate = new Date(startDate);
    endDate.setDate(endDate.getDate() + (7 * durationWeeks));
    
    return {
      start: this.formatDate(startDate),
      end: this.formatDate(endDate),
      duration: `${durationWeeks} weeks`
    };
  }
  
  // AI-accelerated timeline calculations
  aiAcceleratedPhase(phaseNumber, durationDays) {
    const startDate = new Date(this.baseDate);
    startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + (phaseNumber - 1) * durationDays);
    
    const endDate = new Date(startDate);
    endDate.setDate(endDate.getDate() + durationDays);
    
    return {
      start: this.formatDate(startDate),
      end: this.formatDate(endDate),
      duration: `${durationDays} days`
    };
  }
  
  // Calculate acceleration factor
  calculateAcceleration(traditionalWeeks, aiDays) {
    const traditionalDays = traditionalWeeks * 7;
    const accelerationFactor = Math.round(traditionalDays / aiDays * 10) / 10;
    const timeSaved = Math.round((1 - aiDays / traditionalDays) * 100);
    
    return {
      factor: accelerationFactor,
      timeSavedPercent: timeSaved,
      weeksSaved: Math.round((traditionalDays - aiDays) / 7 * 10) / 10
    };
  }
  
  formatDate(date) {
    return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
      year: 'numeric',
      month: 'long',
      day: 'numeric'
    });
  }
}

// Usage Example:
const timeline = new TimelineCalculator('2025-07-20');

// Traditional: 12 weeks total
const traditionalTotal = 12;

// AI-Accelerated: 10 days total  
const aiTotal = 10;

const acceleration = timeline.calculateAcceleration(traditionalTotal, aiTotal);
// Result: 8.4x acceleration, 88% time saved, 11.6 weeks saved
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Always calculate from base date: July 20, 2025
- Update calculations daily to maintain current references
- Include both absolute dates and relative timeframes
- Provide clear acceleration metrics and cost-benefit analysis
- Ensure all timeline documentation includes both traditional and AI-accelerated versions
